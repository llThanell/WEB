        I'm a first year student who interested in coding skills.
        What percentage of students have cheated during an exam in college?
        Problem: Students may be too embarrassed to answer truthfully.
        Randomization comes to the rescue:
        We do a survey that first instructs students to toss a coin twice. If the student gets
        tails on the first toss, then the student has to answer question 1, otherwise the
        student answers question 2.
        Q1: Have you ever cheated on an exam in college?
        Q2: Did you get tails on the second toss?
        So the answer will be partly random: We donnot know whether a yes answer is due to
        the student cheating or to getting tails on the second toss. This should put the student
        at ease to answer truthfully.
