            <h3>Code</h3>
            <p>Hours of coding ‚ò†üéì... And this is a nonsense paragraph to make the design looks better. Eating raw fish didn't sound like a good idea. "It's a delicacy in Japan," didn't seem to make it any more appetizing. Raw fish is raw fish, delicacy or not. "So, what do you think?" he asked nervously. He wanted to know the answer, but at the same time, he didn't. He'd put his heart and soul into the project and he wasn't sure he'd be able to recover if they didn't like what he produced.</p>

            <p>Of course! :3. And this is a nonsense paragraph to make the design looks better. "Do Not Enter." The sign made it clear that they didn't want anyone around. That wasn't going to stop Jack. Jack always lived with the notion that signs were mere suggestions, not actually absolute rules. That's why the moment Jack looked at the "Do Not Enter" sign, he walked past it and onto their property.</p>

            <p>Sometimes I like to play BasketballüèÄ. And this is a nonsense paragraph to make the design looks better. Time is all relative based on age and experience. When you are a child an hour is a long time to wait but a very short time when that‚Äôs all the time you are allowed on your iPad. As a teenager time goes faster the more deadlines you have and the more you procrastinate.</p>

She knew the exact moment that the shyness began. It had been that fateful moment at the lake. There are just some events that do that to you.</p>
